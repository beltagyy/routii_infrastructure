# routii_infrastructure
This project focuses on automating the deployment and management of infrastructure using Terraform. 

# Key Features:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Terraform to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, load balancers, and more.
Environment Management: Implement workspace-based environment management to isolate resources and configurations for different environments.
State Management: Use local backend for state management, ensuring the state file is version-controlled and stored in the Bitbucket repository.
Resource Tainting and Redeployment: Automatically taint all resources to force redeployment, ensuring that all resources are recreated and updated as needed.
CI/CD Integration: Integrate with Bitbucket Pipelines to automate the deployment process, including linting, validation, planning, and applying Terraform changes.
Error Handling and Debugging: Include detailed error handling and debugging steps to ensure smooth execution and quick troubleshooting.




# 1. Terraform Configuration:

Main.tf: Define the main infrastructure resources.
Variables.tf: Declare and manage input variables.
Outputs.tf: Define and manage output values.
Backend.tf: Configure the local backend for state file management.
Modules: Modularize and reuse infrastructure code for components like VPC, EC2, ALB, ECR, IAM, and S3.
Bitbucket Pipeline Configuration:


# 2. Benefits:

Consistency: Ensure that all environments are configured consistently using the same codebase.
Scalability: Easily scale infrastructure up or down based on demand by modifying the Terraform configuration.
Automation: Reduce manual intervention and human error by automating the entire infrastructure provisioning process.
Version Control: Track and manage changes to the infrastructure state using version control, allowing for better collaboration and auditability.
Remote Backend Integration: Move the state file management to a remote backend like AWS S3 for better scalability and collaboration.


# 3. Future Enhancements:

Advanced CI/CD Pipelines: Incorporate more advanced CI/CD practices, including automated testing and rollback mechanisms.
Monitoring and Alerts: Integrate monitoring tools to provide insights into infrastructure performance and set up alerts for proactive issue resolution.
